This project is designed to ensure that all elements are displayed correctly across popular screen sizes, providing a seamless and visually consistent experience. It is built with a responsive design approach, meaning it adapts smoothly to both mobile devices and desktop computers. Whether viewed on a small smartphone screen or a large monitor, the layout remains functional, user-friendly, and aesthetically appealing.
